# Restaurant-Management-System
1.	Overview

Azure is a software developed for online table reservations, food delivery, and food delivery services. Our aim is to reduce the workforce which would benefit the company financially. Since, food industry is one of the biggest in Pakistan especially in Karachi and one negative review can turn the restaurant’s reputation upside down, we will be targeting multiple restaurants, cafes and chalets of the city. It would be a waiter less Restaurant in which the orders would be placed online. This would benefit the customer from hectic situations. This project idea is a new software to revolutionize the food industry by solving some of the main problems of the industry through technical solutions. The software will update their customers through multiple services for providing bills and confirmation notifications for table reservation and food order. From the user point of view, user will find it easily to collect the data from their cell-phone instead of providing the bills and charges of the restaurant, food, and food delivery services respectively.
Since it is a new project, we will be starting to work on this project from scratch. The estimated time to complete this project is 4 months, and we hope to finish it by the end of December 2019. As this is a stand-alone project in the food industry; therefore, we wish to work on this project idea in future as well and keep on developing and enhancing it as much as possible.

  2.1	Project Goals

  With Azure, our goal is to provide a qualified system of management that would transform the restaurant management industry. This can be achieved by maximizing the work-time efficiency without increasing any burden on resources consumed. Azure assures a win-win situation for both the customers and the restaurant. 

  For the restaurant, they would now be able to have a schedule and a record of their bookings, the variety and the quantity of foods that have to be prepared and the expected crowd in the restaurant. All this can bring a noticeable decrease in excess food wastage, resulting in the cut down of extra costs and efforts while keeping the environment clean. Apart from this, the order preparation can now be more organized and productive as the staff would know what and when to prepare, leading to a noticeable improvement in the quality of food provided. A key aspect of this system is to cut down the time consumed in order taking and its preparation. The efficiency of work would help enhance the customer satisfaction which can play a key role in positive image building of the restaurant. Hence, an increased revenue generation. 

  Last, but not the least, Azure also brings to the table, the marketing solutions for every restaurant. The long existed problem of approaching the walk-in customers can now be solved with the data base of customers’ record. This would ensure the back tracking of old customers and marketing campaigns can then be led to keep the customers engaged.
  Over all, Azure is all about a high end business growth with the lowest investments possible.

  With its customer obsessed approach, Azure is keen to provide the customer satisfaction that people have longed for from decades. With the fast paced system of living in today’s time, saving idle time has become an utmost desire of this busy generation. The availability of freshly cooked meals in no time can prove to be a heavenly experience for many. Furthermore, with Azure, long would be gone the days when people would wait in queues as a result of a ‘full house’ in any restaurant. In fact, the restaurants would now wait for their customers to serve them with promised meals on promised times. Continuing with its mission of ‘Simpler for Better’ Azure’s database would allow customers to have the luxury of performing operations like selecting their favorite meal plans, and checking out their order history. This can be of a great help, especially while availing food delivery services. Last but not the least, customers would always be welcomed to provide their feedbacks which would help improve their experiences in future.

  Other goals in creating a customer oriented atmosphere can include a connection with the transportation industry. Azure plans to not just take care of a good ‘in restaurant experience’, but also a ‘to and from restaurant experience’ as well. With Azure, the customers can also have an added benefit of choosing their pick up and drop off locations before and after the dine-in experience. The software would then connect with cab booking services to schedule their rides.

  No matter how pleasing an idea may seem to be, there always are some hurdles in its implementation and same is the case with Azure.
  The first issue with this idea is that it’s website and not an app. In today’s time, people’s preference is more towards apps as compared to websites because of apps being simpler to use and less time consuming. The future prospects of aspect of Azure would definitely include a plan for app creation, but as for now, the lacking stays due to it being a new start up with no backups available.
  Another issue that lies with the actual implementation of the idea is that of it requiring a big database to accommodate for the information of all the restaurants, the client records, order histories for individual clients, the lists of liked restaurants, the reservations of tables and the record of promised orders etc. All this would result in high maintenance costs for operations.
  In case of providing restaurant maps for table reservations, it would take a lot of efforts in generating a detailed map of restaurants’ interior plans (unless if it would directly be provided by the restaurants) as it would be unique for every eatery.


  2.2	Project Scope
    Currently, our restaurant management system is limited to a website. The groups of user that have been identified to use the system are customer and administrator. These users will be able to use the online restaurant booking. We will also be using certain API’s to help enhance our project. The online restaurant management system is further divided into the following main parts with respect to the customer;

  •	Online Food Ordering
  Customer will be able to order food online by selecting the available items on the menu. This is applicable for home delivery, take away and dine in. 
  •	Online Bill Payment
  Once the order is confirmed an email will be sent to the customer attached with the bill of his order. Customer can then pay his bill at the time of food delivery or when he is taking his order from restaurant. 
  •	Online Table Reservation 
  Customer will be able to make a table reservation online just by picking his desired table form the available table in the restaurant. Confirmation mail will be sent to his email address and once the booking is confirmed through email confirmation customer will successfully reserve his desired table. 
  •	Online Food Pre-order
  Customer will be able to decide and order the food that he wants to eat when he dines in the restaurant. This can be done during or after the online table reservation. 

  Administrator is the person who will manage the entire system. This type of user will also do maintenance and control the application of this system. Administrator takes a responsibility to register and the system will have the following functionalities for the admin;

  •	Add/Remove Employee Data
  The admin will have the rights to add and delete existing and new employee information at any time.
  •	Manage Customer Information
  The admin will be able to manage the customer information, and use it accordingly	
  •	Manage Reservations
  The admin will be able to manage reservations. They can cancel reservations if there’s a need for that. This may happen when the reservations for a particular time may exceed.
  •	Manage Restaurant’s Menu
  The admin can add and delete items into the menu. The admin will also be able to change the description and the picture of the items that are currently available.
  •	Send Emails
  The admin can directly send emails to customers and employees with the help of their information stored in the database.
  •	Reply to Customer Feedback
    Customer feedbacks can also be directly replied to with an email.

	In the future, we intend to take it further by also converting it into a mobile application. This way more people can access it in a much more convenient manner. Apart from that, we also plan on taking the experience to a whole new level. We will do this by integrating a hotel management system with our current management system.
